# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns with different kinds of implementation, different attributes, pros/cons, different languages implementation

##Liability: 
By using or reading anything here, you agree that I am no liable for anything.

##Goal: 
    A Short and sweet summation of Design Patterns. This is meant just for me and random people I teach very rarely to. 
    This is not meant to teach you Design Patterns but as a reminder. There is a lot more to design patterns than just using them.
    
    
## Repo Usage
The main branch and readme will include a General Idea and sense of the design patterns. 
Only one language will be on the Main branch for specific design pattern. Different Languages will be put in branches.

## Languages
Included: C#, Python, Java and more maybe later.
Why these ? 
1. The languages are implemented differently so different constraints on implementation.
2. C# is my current favorite language.
3. Python because I want to practise and learn it.
4. Java because friends need to learn as well ;).
